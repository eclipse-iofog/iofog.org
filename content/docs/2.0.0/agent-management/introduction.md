  <p>In order to manage Agents, we need a working Edge Compute Network (ECN) with running Agents. The previous section on <a href="../platform-deployment/introduction.html">Platform Deployment</a> goes through ECN setup and is required in order to do Agent management.</p>

  <p>This section describes a set of independent Agent management operations, hence there is no natural flow nor dependencies. Feel free to explore any topic in this section.</p>
  
  <p>If one wants to dive deeper into Agent internals, we recommend also checking out <a href="../reference-agent/overview.html">Agent reference</a> documentation.</p>
