  <p>There are two flavours of Control Plane deployments - Remote and Kubernetes. This guide will focus on deploying a Remote Control Plane on a single Linux remote host.

# Remote Host - Deploy Control Plane

Every Edge Compute Network ('ECN') starts with a Control Plane that allows us to manage ECN's resources.

In this guide, our Control Plane will deploy a single Controller instance on a remote host.

  <h3><img src="/images/icos/ico-note.svg" alt="">We use YAML to define ioFog resources</h3>
  <p>The following procedures will define resources in YAML for iofogctl to consume. Specification of those YAML resources can be found <a href=../reference-iofogctl/reference-control-plane.html>here</a>.</p>

## Deploy a Control Plane on a Remote Host

Create a template of controlplane.yaml like so:

```bash
echo "---
apiVersion: iofog.org/v2
kind: ControlPlane
metadata:
  name: albatros
spec:
  iofogUser:
    name: Foo
    surname: Bar
    email: user@domain.com
    password: iht234g9afhe
  controllers:
  - name: alpaca-1
    host: 38.101.23.2
    ssh:
      user: bar
      keyFile: ~/.ssh/id_rsa" > /tmp/controlplane.yaml
```

Make sure to edit the `host`, `ssh.user`, and `ssh.keyFile` fields to correspond with the remote host we are deploying to.

Once we have edited the fields to our liking, go ahead and run:

```bash
iofogctl deploy -f /tmp/controlplane.yaml
```

## Verify the Deployment

We can use the following commands to verify the Control Plane is up and running:

```bash
iofogctl get controllers
```

```bash
iofogctl describe controller alpaca-1
```

```bash
iofogctl describe controlplane
```

  <p>Having our Control Plane up and running, we can now go to <a href="setup-your-agents.html">Setup Agents</a> guide to deploy our Agents and finalize the ECN deployment.</p>
