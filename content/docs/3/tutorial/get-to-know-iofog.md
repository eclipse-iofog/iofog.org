# Get To Know ioFog

In this step of the tutorial we'll better familiarize ourselves with the ioFog environment [we just set up](introduction.html) in the previous step and `iofogctl`.

## Check Your Environment

You can have a comprehensive view of your Edge Cloud Network (ECN) and the running docker containers by using our `./status.sh` shell script.

```bash
./status.sh
```

Or you can manually verify that the ioFog stack containers are correctly started. Note that it may take a minute or two for ioFog to start the tutorial microservices. The output should look like the following.

```console
iofogctl get all

```

We can also see that in the PORTS column some of these containers have published [port mappings](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/):

For example, there's a microservice running an instance of [Freeboard](https://github.com/Freeboard/freeboard), an open source visualization dashboard for IoT devices. It's running a web server that serves the dashboard.

Wait for the microservices to be in a `RUNNING` state. It may take a few minutes as the images need to be pulled.

```bash
watch iofogctl get microservices
```

Go ahead and try the web app out at http://localhost:10102/?load=dashboard.json

The Freeboard microservice doesn't know it's running locally, so it could just as well be running on real edge node hardware!

## ioFog Containers

Our tutorial environment has two ioFog containers:

- [Agents](../reference-agent/overview.html)
- [Controllers](../reference-controller/overview.html)

We can think of each of these containers as if they were deployed on separate devices. In production, our Controller is most often running on a cloud server and our Agents are each running on individual edge devices in the field. The Controller is controlling the Agent the same way it would if the devices were hundreds of miles away.

### iofogctl vs component CLIs

We are currently in the process of migrating all our management system into one tool to rule them all: `iofogctl` !

However, this process is still ongoing and even though you can do everything you need for this tutorial (and much more...) in iofogctl, you must know that every ioFog component (Agent and Controller) has its local CLI (iofog-agent, iofog-controller) that can prove itself useful.

In the following sections we will us `iofogctl legacy ...` commands to use the older component CLIs. Note that, because we have a local ECN, we could also use `docker exec` instead.

#### Agent's Container

Let's start by using `iofogctl` to retrieve a detailed description of our Agent.

```console
iofogctl describe agent local-agent

apiVersion: iofog.org/v2
kind: AgentConfig
metadata:
  name: local-agent
  namespace: default
spec:
  uuid: 62GHyYgrGrfbYfhxwk9Q8LQW34VVMtKq
  name: local-agent
  location: ""
  latitude: -36.8486
  longitude: 174.754
  description: ""
  dockerUrl: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
  diskLimit: 50
  diskDirectory: /var/lib/iofog-agent/
...
```

Let's see how we can use the legacy `iofog-agent` CLI to find out its status.

```console
iofogctl legacy agent local-agent status

ioFog daemon                : RUNNING
Memory Usage                : about 51.19 MiB
Disk Usage                  : about 0.19 MiB
CPU Usage                   : about 0.99 %
Running Microservices       : 4
Connection to Controller    : ok
Messages Processed          : about 837

System Available Memory     : 2717.61 MB
System Total CPU            : 32.58 %
```

There's also the legacy `info` command, used to view this Agent's settings:

```console
iofogctl legacy agent local-agent info

Iofog UUID                               : VB78m6tLdrtWNDgdr73VrmCxZ3ZRkxjB

#### Controller's Container

Let's list all the configured ioFog nodes using `iofogctl`.

```console
iofogctl get agents

NAMESPACE
default

AGENT       STATUS   AGE     UPTIME  ADDR             VERSION
local-agent	RUNNING  15m38s  15m38s  104.196.255.116  3.0.0
```

Now, let's try listing all the preconfigured ioFog nodes using the Controller CLI.

```console
iofogctl legacy controller local-controller iofog list

{
  "fogs": [
    {
      "lastActive": 1587360831027,
      "daemonOperatingDuration": 937515,
      "daemonLastStart": 1587359873075,
      "systemAvailableDisk": 4780654592,
      "systemAvailableMemory": 2847510528,
      "repositoryCount": 2,
      "systemTime": 1587360773069,
      "lastStatusTime": 1587360811615,
      "processedMessages": 848,
      "messageSpeed": 1,
      "lastCommandTime": 0,
      "logFileCount": 10,
      "uuid": "VB78m6tLdrtWNDgdr73VrmCxZ3ZRkxjB",
      "name": "local-agent",
...
```

This should give us a JSON response containing a list of edge nodes already registered with the Controller. In our case we should get a single node, `"name": "local-agent"`. This "node" is the container environment of iofog-agent. Remember that in production, instead of being containers running locally on our machine, these nodes would be real edge hardware as part of our Edge Compute Network (ECN), where our microservices run.

## Manage Our Microservices

Now that we know our way around a bit, let's learn how to manage and launch microservices!
