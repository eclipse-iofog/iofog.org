# Application YAML Specification

`iofogctl` allows users to deploy sets of Microservices to Edge Compute Networks ('ECNs'). The various components of Microservices are specified within YAML files for `iofogctl` to consume.

An application is a set of Microservices working together to achieve one specific purpose.

An application is defined by a YAML file. This file is passed as a parameter to the deploy command: `iofogctl deploy -f <path-to-yaml>`

An application YAML file definition can be retrieved with the describe command: `iofogctl describe application <NAME> [-o <path-to-yaml>]`

Don't panic if this seems like a lot to digest, the [microservice yaml definition](#microservices) is explained in more details further down.
The main take away is that an application is defined by: a `name`, a set of `microservices` and a set of `routes`.

## Deploying an application

```yaml
apiVersion: iofog.org/v2
kind: Application # What are we deploying
metadata:
  name: health-care-wearable # Application name
  namespace: default # (Optional) iofogctl namespace to use

# Specifications of the application
spec:
  # List of microservices composing your application
  microservices:
    #  # It uses the microservice YAML schema described below
    - name: heart-rate-monitor
      agent:
        name: horse-1
      images:
        arm: edgeworx/healthcare-heart-rate:arm-v1
        x86: edgeworx/healthcare-heart-rate:x86-v1
        # registry: remote
      container:
        rootHostAccess: false
        ports: []
      config:
        test_mode: true
        data_label: Anonymous Person
        nested_object:
          key: 42
          deep_nested:
            foo: bar
    # Simple JSON viewer for the heart rate output
    - name: heart-rate-viewer
      agent:
        name: horse-1
      images:
        arm: edgeworx/healthcare-heart-rate-ui:arm
        x86: edgeworx/healthcare-heart-rate-ui:x86
        registry: remote
      container:
        rootHostAccess: false
        ports:
          - internal: 80
            external: 5000
            public: 5001
            protocol: tcp
        env:
          - key: BASE_URL
            value: http://localhost:8080/data
      config:
        test: 54
  routes:
    # Use this section to configure route between microservices
    # Use microservice name
    - name: monitor-to-viewer
      from: heart-rate-monitor
      to: heart-rate-viewer
```

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name          | User-defined unique identifier of an Application within an ioFog Controller. Must start and end with lowercase alphanumeric character. Can include '-' character.                                                           |
| microservices | List of Microservices. See Microservice section for more details.                                                                                                                                                           |
| routes        | List of ioFog Routes. `From` and `To` use microservice name as identifiers. The microservices specified must be part of the application. When deploying an application, prefer this method to the microservice route field. |

### Microservices

Microservices configuration and set up are defined using YAML files.

Those YAML definitions can be used inside an application YAML file, or by themselves when deploying a microservice to an existing application: `iofogctl deploy microservice -f <path-to-microservice.yaml>`

A microservice YAML definition file can be retrieved using the describe command: `iofogctl describe microservice <NAME> [-o microservice.yaml]`
