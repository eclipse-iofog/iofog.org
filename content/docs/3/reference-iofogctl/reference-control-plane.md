# Control Plane YAML Specification

`iofogctl` allows users to deploy Edge Compute Networks ('ECNs'). The various resources which constitute an ECN are specified within YAML files for iofogctl to consume.

  <h3><img src="/images/icos/ico-note.svg" alt="">Trying to use iofogctl 3.0 with an older ECN?</h3>
  <p>You can connect to an older ECN with iofogctl 3.0 for view-only purposes. If you would like full control over the ECN with iofogctl 3.0, you should delete the ECN with your older iofogctl and then redeploy with iofogctl 3.0.</p>

## Kubernetes Control Plane

The Kubernetes Control Plane specifies all the resources required to deploy the ioFog Control Plane on a Kubernetes cluster.

```yaml

  name: buffalo
  namespace: default
spec:
  iofogUser:
    name: Foo
    surname: Bar

## Edge Compute Network

An entire ECN can be specified within a single YAML file.

Multiple resources can be incorporated into a single YAML file using `---` as a separator.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: iofog.org/v2
kind: ControlPlane
metadata:
  name: buffalo
  namespace: default
spec:
  iofogUser:
    name: John
    surname: Doe
    email: user@example.com
    password: mysecretpw
  controllers:
    - name: alpaca-1
      host: 30.40.50.3
      ssh:
        user: john
        keyFile: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    - name: alpaca-2
      host: 30.40.50.4
      ssh:
        user: john
        keyFile: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
---
apiVersion: iofog.org/v2
kind: Agent

  name: hippo-1
  namespace: default
spec:
  host: 30.40.50.6
  ssh:
    user: john
    keyFile: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
---
apiVersion: iofog.org/v2
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: hippo-2
