# Distributed Applications

ioFog is a platform for running distributed applications on Edge Compute Networks. A distributed application is made up of some number of microservices.

We can specify distributed applications in YAML through iofogctl's [Application kind](../reference-iofogctl/reference-application.html#application). We can then deploy an entire distributed application through iofogctl by using this specification:

```bash
iofogctl deploy -f application.yaml
```

We can also deploy individual microservices if we wish. The iofogctl [Microservice kind](../reference-iofogctl/reference-application.html#microservices) allows us to do this.

```bash
iofogctl deploy -f microservice.yaml
```

The rest of this section will cover how we can manage our distributed applications and microservices after we have deployed them.
