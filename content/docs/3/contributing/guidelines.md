### Getting Help

Need some help? Check out the [Community](/community.html) page for resources like our discussion forums and meetups.

### Sending a Pull Request

For non-trivial changes, we suggest you open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. That way you can get better insight into whether or not your hard work is likely to be accepted.

On the other hand, sometimes the best way to start a conversation _is_ to send a pull request. Use your best judgment!

In general, the contribution workflow looks like this:

- Open a new issue in the issue tracker.
- Fork the repo.
- Create a new feature branch based off the `develop` branch.
- Make sure all tests pass and there are no linting errors.
- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request is focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, we’ll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!
