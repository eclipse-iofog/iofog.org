We are going to introduce all of these one by one and show what capabilities they bring into the system, and how they are commonly deployed. Instances of these ioFog components form a logical component called Edge Compute Network (ECN). We will gradually build up the definition of ioFog ECN from a bare bone ECN to a more robust, even heterogeneous ECN.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in deeper dive into any of these components, and figuring out how to use them, there are links to documentation and their repositories in all the relevant sections.</p>\n<h2 id=\"controller\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#controller\" aria-label=\"controller permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Controller</h2>\n<p>The ioFog Controller is the heart of each Edge Compute Network. The Controller orchestrates all Agents, Microservices, Routers, users, and much more.</p>\n<p>Controller can run on any compatible hardware that is network accessible by all of your edge nodes running an Agent. Usually that means either having a static IP address or DNS records. A common solution is to run your Controller on a cloud provider like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services</a> or <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\">Google Cloud Platform</a>, but it's also possible to run the Controller directly on one of your edge nodes or other local hardware, both as a native daemon or containerized.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to have a Controller hidden behind HTTP Ingress service, since the Controller is fully functional using its REST API only.</p>\n<aside class=\"notifications note\">\n  <h3><img src=\"/images/icos/ico-note.svg\" alt>Want to know more about ioFog Controller?</h3>\n  <p>If you want to learn advanced features, how to configure the Controller or how to directly use it, go to <a href=\"../reference-controller/overview.html\">Controller reference documentation</a>.</p>\n  <p>To deploy and use the Controller via iofogctl, go to <a href=\"../platform-deployment/introduction.html\">platform deployment documentation</a>.</p>\n  <p>Feel free to also explore and potentially contribute at the <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse-iofog/Controller\">eclipse-iofog/Controller github repository</a>.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2 id=\"agent\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#agent\" aria-label=\"agent permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Agent</h2>\n<p>The ioFog Agent is the worker ant of an Edge Compute Network. Each Agents allows for running microservices, mounting volumes, managing resources, etc. An ioFog Agent reports directly the a Controller, hence why the Controller has to be accessible from the outside, but not the other way.</p>\n<p>Each Agent manages microservice as Docker containers and is responsible for managing their lifespan and managing Docker images of these containers.</p>\n<p>Agents would be typically deployed on the edge as native daemons. Multiple architectures and platforms are supported to ioFog Agents, with the possibility of the ioFog community implementing their own agents according to the Controller to Agent REST API.</p>\n<p>While the Agent daemon itself has a CLI, after setting things up a majority of your management tasks will instead be done indirectly using the <a href=\"#controller\">Controller</a>, which controls the Agent on your behalf, remotely. This allows you to deploy and maintain microservices without needing to SSH directly onto every edge node device. In fact, you will never need to SSH into your agents yourself.</p>\n<aside class=\"notifications note\">\n  <h3><img src=\"/images/icos/ico-note.svg\" alt>Want to know more about ioFog Agent?</h3>\n  <p>If you want to learn advanced features, how to configure the Agent or how to directly use it, go to <a href=\"../reference-agent/overview.html\">Agent reference documentation</a>.</p>\n  <p>To deploy and use the Agent via iofogctl, go to <a href=\"../agent-management/introduction.html\">Agent management documentation</a>.</p>\n  <p>Feel free to also explore and potentially contribute at the <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse-iofog/Agent\">eclipse-iofog/Agent github repository</a>.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2 id=\"microservices\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#microservices\" aria-label=\"microservices permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Microservices</h2>\n<p>The last absolutely essential components in edge computing are microservices.

These Edge Routers are by default connected to the Interior Router.</p>\n<p>For advanced users, it is possible to configure the topology manually, such as sharing Edge Routers between Agents, or hosting Interior routers on Agents instead of Controller. It is also possible to have a direct Agent communication using these Edge Routers on the same network, or accessible from other Agents.
